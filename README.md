=BattleTech Calculator=

A calculator to keep your BattleTech game moving, without losing your place in all the math.

We find that one of the more tedious parts of this excellent game, is stopping to do the math. It's not that it's tough, just that there's so much of it. Your Gunnery skill, your own movement, the two tree tiles, your own movement (did I do that already?), your target's movement (no, you did that one already, or did you?). So we sit there all finger-counting, while a computer could help us to keep it organized.

So, BattleTech Calculator. Punch in your Gunnery and Piloting skills, select some mech quirks and check the range and cover, and keep the game moving. It even has dice, if you're into letting a computer have _all_ of the fun.
